# ✈️ FlightMoney

Track how much gold and time your character spends on flight paths in World of Warcraft.

This is mostly a stupid idea I had while playing World of Warcraft Classic Hardcode.

I wondered, how much gold we spend on flight? And how much time.

Now we are able to know.

## 🔍 Features

- Tracks total flight gold spent
- Tracks total flight time
- Detailed sortable flight history
- Export/import your flight data
- Works with both **Classic** and **Retail**
